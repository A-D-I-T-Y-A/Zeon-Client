# Zeon-Client
A Minecraft 1.12 hacked client. 

This client aims to be an open source client that encourages community contribution.

Most clients provide individual hacks and no client provides a way to use these utilities in a synchronized manner.

**Zeon** aims to provide automation to players by combining a variety of utilities to accomplish various tasks.

To avoid copyright infringement, the minecraft source has been omitted from the repo.

How to compile:

  *This assumes you atleast know the basics of minecraft client modification. If not, I recommend you do that first*
  * Decompile Minecraft using mcp.
  * Copy the source files from repo to the /src/minecraft generated by mcp.
  * Make necessary changes in Minecraft source to attach the hooks.
  * Resolve any jar dependency errors
  * Compile and run
